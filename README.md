Work in progress....

This library will be for converting images (changing formats) in/from PHP.
Ie jpeg->webp, png->jpeg, jpeg->avif etc.

I have started off by copying webp-convert. This is the base, which I am going to modify into a general image conversion library



Notes to self:
For jpeg xl, I can look at this library: https://github.com/joppuyo/jpeg-xl-encode
