            - Squoosh uses "cqLevel" (0-63), and allows separate alpha quality (cqAlphaLevel)

            - gd uses "quality" (from -1 to 100). -1 means "reuse libavif default". 0 is worst

            vips for some reason generates a little bit larger avif than imagemagick, but its around the same for all
            quality settings, so they probably have the same view of what quality means
            they both create significantly larger avif with quality 80 than webp with quality 80
